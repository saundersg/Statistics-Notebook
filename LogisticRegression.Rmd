</div>

Regression for a qualitative binary response variable $(Y_i = 0$ or $1)$ using a single (typically quantitative) explanatory variable.

### Overview

<div style="padding-left:125px;">

The probability that $Y_i = 1$ given the observed value of $x_i$ is called $\pi_i$ and is modeled by the equation

<div style="float:right;font-size:.8em;background-color:lightgray;padding:5px;border-radius:4px;"><a style="color:darkgray;" href="javascript:showhide('simplelogisticlatexrcode')">Math Code</a></div>


<div id="simplelogisticlatexrcode" style="display:none;">
```{}
$$
  P(Y_i = 1|\, x_i) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}}{1+e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}} = \pi_i
$$

  <span class="tooltiprtext">The $\pi_i$ stands for the probability of individual $i$ having a y-value equal to 1 given their $x_i$ value. It is the short hand notation for $P(Y_i = 1 |x_i)$. (It is NOT the number 3.14...)</span>
</span>
</center>

<br/>







The coefficents $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are difficult to interpret directly. Typicall $e^{\beta_0}$ and $e^{\beta_1}$ are interpreted instead. The value of $e^{\beta_0}$ or $e^{\beta_1}$ denotes the relative change in the odds that $Y_i=1$. The odds that $Y_i=1$ are $\frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}$.

#### Diagnose the Goodness-of-Fit

There are two ways to check the **goodness of fit** of a logistic regression model.

<div style="padding-left:25px;">
**Option 1**: Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test (Most Common)

To check the **goodness of fit** of a logistic regression model where there are **few or no replicated $x$-values** use the Hosmer-Lemeshow Test.

<a href="javascript:showhide('goodnessoffit2')">
<div class="hoverchunk">
<span class="tooltipr">
library(ResourceSelection)
  <span class="tooltiprtext">This loads the ResourceSelection R package so that you can access the hoslem.test() function. You may need to run the code: install.packages("ResourceSelection") first.</span>
</span><br/><span class="tooltipr">
hoslem.test(
  <span class="tooltiprtext">This R function performs the Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit Test. See the "Explanation" file to learn about this test.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
YourGlmName
  <span class="tooltiprtext">`YourGlmName` is the name of your glm(...) code that you created previously.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
\$y,&nbsp;
  <span class="tooltiprtext">ALWAYS type a "y" here. This gives you the actual binary (0,1) y-values of your logistic regression. The goodness of fit test will compare these actual values to your predicted probabilities for each value in order to see if the model is a "good fit."</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
YourGlmName
  <span class="tooltiprtext">`YourGlmName` is the name you used to save the results of your glm(...) code.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
\$fitted,&nbsp;
  <span class="tooltiprtext">ALWAYS type "fitted" here. This gives you the fitted probabilities $\pi_i$ of your logistic regression.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
g=10)
  <span class="tooltiprtext">The "g=10" is the default option for the value of g. The g is the number of groups to run the goodness of fit test on. Just leave it at 10 unless you are told to do otherwise. Ask your teacher for more information if you are interested.</span>
</span>
</div>
</a>

<div id="goodnessoffit2" style="display:none;">
```{r, echo=FALSE}
myglm <- glm(am ~ disp, data = mtcars, family = binomial)
library(ResourceSelection)
hoslem.test(myglm$y, myglm$fitted)
```

Note that the null hypothesis of the goodness-of-fit test is that "the logistic regression is a good fit." So we actually don't want to "reject the null" in this case. So a large p-value here means our logistic regression fits the data satisfactorily. A small p-value implies a poor fit and the results of the logistic regression should not be fully trusted.

</div>

<br/>

**Option 2**: Deviance Goodness-of-fit Test (Less Common)

In some cases, there are **many replicated $x$-values** for **all** x-values, i.e.,  each value of x is repeated more than 50 times. Though this is rare, it is good to use the *deviance goodness-of-fit test* whenever this happens.

<a href="javascript:showhide('goodnessoffit1')">
<div class="hoverchunk">
<span class="tooltipr">
pchisq(
  <span class="tooltiprtext">The `pchisq` command allows you to compute p-values from the chi-squared distribution.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
residual deviance,&nbsp;
  <span class="tooltiprtext">The residual deviance is shown at the bottom of the output of your `summary(YourGlmName)` and should be typed in here as a number like 25.3.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
df for residual deviance,&nbsp;
  <span class="tooltiprtext">The df for the residual deviance is also shown at the bottom of the output of your `summary(YourGlmName)`.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
lower.tail=FALSE)
<span class="tooltiprtext">This command ensures you find the probability of the chi-squared distribution being as extreme or more extreme than the observed value of residual deviance.</span>
</span>
</div>
</a>


<div id="goodnessoffit1" style="display:none;">
```{r, echo=FALSE}
myglm <- glm(am ~ disp, data = mtcars, family = binomial)
summary(myglm)
pchisq(29.732, 30, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

The null hypothesis of the goodness-of-fit test is that the logistic regression is a good fit of the data. So a large p-value (like 0.479) is good because it allows us to trust the results of our logistic regression. When the p-value becomes very small, we must "reject the null" and conclude a poor fit, which implies that we should not trust the results of the logistic regression.

### Explanation

<div style="padding-left:125px;">


Simple Logistic Regression is used when 

* the response variable is binary $(Y_i=0$ or $1)$, and
* there is a single explanatory variable $X$ that is typically quantitative but could be qualitative (if $X$ is binary or ordinal).


#### The Model 

Since $Y_i$ is binary (can only be 0 or 1) the model focuses on describing the probability that $Y_i=1$ for a given scenario. The probability that $Y_i = 1$ given the observed value of $x_i$ is called $\pi_i$ and is modeled by the equation

$$
  P(Y_i = 1|\, x_i) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}}{1+e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}} = \pi_i
$$

The assumption is that for certain values of $X$ the probability that $Y_i=1$ is higher than for other values of $X$. 


#### Interpretation

This model for $\pi_i$ comes from modeling the *log of the odds* that $Y_i=1$ using a linear regression, i.e., 
$$
  \log\underbrace{\left(\frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right)}_{\text{Odds for}\ Y_i=1} = \underbrace{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}_{\text{linear regression}}
$$ 
Beginning to solve this equation for $\pi_i$ leads to the intermediate, but important result that
$$
    \underbrace{\frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}}_{\text{Odds for}\ Y_i=1} = e^{\overbrace{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}^{\text{linear regression}}} = e^{\beta_0}e^{\beta_1 x_i}
$$
Thus, while the coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are difficult to interpret directly, $e^{\beta_0}$ and $e^{\beta_1}$ have a valuable interpretation. The value of $e^{\beta_0}$ is interpreted as the odds for $Y_i=1$ when $x_i = 0$. It may not be possible for a given model to have $x_i=0$, in which case $e^{\beta_0}$ has no interpretation. The value of $e^{\beta_1}$ denotes the proportional change in the odds that $Y_i=1$ for every one unit increase in $x_i$. 

Notice that solving the last equation for $\pi_i$ results in the logistic regression model presented at the beginning of this page.


#### Hypothesis Testing

Similar to linear regression, the hypothesis that
$$
  H_0: \beta_1 = 0 \\
  H_a: \beta_1 \neq 0
$$
can be tested with a logistic regression. If $\beta_1 = 0$, then there is no relationship between $x_i$ and the log of the odds that $Y_i = 1$. In other words, $x_i$ is not useful in predicting the probability that $Y_i = 1$. If $\beta_1 \neq 0$, then there is information in $x_i$ that can be utilized to predict the probability that $Y_i = 1$, i.e., the logistic regression is meaningful.


#### Checking Model Assumptions {#diagnostics}

The model assumptions are not as clear in logistic regression as they are in linear regression. For our purposes we will focus only on considering the goodness of fit of the logistic regression model. If the model appears to fit the data well, then it will be assumed to be appropriate.

<div style="padding-left:15px;">

##### Deviance Goodness of Fit Test

If there are replicated values of each $x_i$, then the deviance goodness of fit test tests the hypotheses
$$
  H_0: \pi_i = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}}{1+e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}}
$$
$$
  H_a: \pi_i \neq \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}}{1+e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i}}
$$


##### Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit Test

If there are very few or no replicated values of each $x_i$, then the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test can be used to test these same hypotheses. In each case, the null assumes that logistic regression is a good fit for the data while the alternative is that logistic regression is not a good fit. 

</div>

#### Prediction

One of the great uses of Logistic Regression is that it provides an estimate of the probability that $Y_i=1$ for a given value of $x_i$. This probability is often referred to as the *risk* that $Y_i=1$ for a certain individual. For example, if $Y_i=1$ implies a person has a disease, then $\pi_i=P(Y_i=1)$ represents the risk of individual $i$ having the disease based on their value of $x_i$, perhaps a measure of their cholesterol or some other predictor of the disease.

## Multiple Logistic Regression Model {.tabset .tabset-pills .tabset-fade}


<div style="float:left;width:125px;" align=center>
<img src="./Images/BinomYMultX.png" width=98px;>
</div>

Logistic regression for multiple explanatory variables that can either be quantitative or qualitative or a mixture of the two.


### Overview

<div style="padding-left:125px;">

The probability that $Y_i = 1$ given the observed data $(x_{i1},\ldots,x_{ip})$ is called $\pi_i$ and is modeled by the equation

$$
  P(Y_i = 1|\, x_{i1},\ldots,x_{ip}) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip}}}{1+e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip} }} = \pi_i
$$

The coefficents $\beta_0,\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_p$ are difficult to interpret directly. Typically $e^{\beta_k}$ for $k=0,1,\ldots,p$ is interpreted instead. The value of $e^{\beta_k}$ denotes the relative change in the odds that $Y_i=1$. The odds that $Y_i=1$ are $\frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}$.

#### Diagnose the Goodness-of-Fit

There are two ways to check the **goodness of fit** of a logistic regression model.

<div style="padding-left:25px;">
**Option 1**: Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test

To check the **goodness of fit** of a logistic regression model where there are **few or no replicated $x$-values** use the Hosmer-Lemeshow Test.

<a href="javascript:showhide('goodnessoffit2')">
<div class="hoverchunk">
<span class="tooltipr">
library(ResourceSelection)
  <span class="tooltiprtext">This loads the ResourceSelection R package so that you can access the hoslem.test() function. You may need to run the code: install.packages("ResourceSelection") first.</span>
</span><br/><span class="tooltipr">
hoslem.test(
  <span class="tooltiprtext">This R function performs the Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of Fit Test. See the "Explanation" file to learn about this test.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
YourGlmName
  <span class="tooltiprtext">`YourGlmName` is the name of your glm(...) code that you created previously.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
\$y,&nbsp;
  <span class="tooltiprtext">ALWAYS type a "y" here. This gives you the actual binary (0,1) y-values of your logistic regression. The goodness of fit test will compare these actual values to your predicted probabilities for each value in order to see if the model is a "good fit."</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
YourGlmName
  <span class="tooltiprtext">`YourGlmName` is the name you used to save the results of your glm(...) code.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
\$fitted,&nbsp;
  <span class="tooltiprtext">ALWAYS type "fitted" here. This gives you the fitted probabilities $\pi_i$ of your logistic regression.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
g=10)
  <span class="tooltiprtext">The "g=10" is the default option for the value of g. The g is the number of groups to run the goodness of fit test on. Just leave it at 10 unless you are told to do otherwise. Ask your teacher for more information if you are interested.</span>
</span>
</div>
</a>

<div id="goodnessoffit2" style="display:none;">
```{r, echo=FALSE}
myglm <- glm(weight>100 ~ Time*Diet, data = ChickWeight, family = binomial)
library(ResourceSelection)
hoslem.test(myglm$y, myglm$fitted)
```

Note that the null hypothesis of the goodness-of-fit test is that "the logistic regression is a good fit." So we actually don't want to "reject the null" in this case. So a large p-value here means our logistic regression fits the data satisfactorily. A small p-value implies a poor fit and the results of the logistic regression should not be fully trusted.

</div>

<br/>

**Option 2**: Deviance Goodness-of-fit Test

In some cases, there are **many replicated $x$-values** for **all** x-values. Though this is rare, it is good to use the *deviance goodness-of-fit test* whenever this happens.

<a href="javascript:showhide('goodnessoffit1')">
<div class="hoverchunk">
<span class="tooltipr">
pchisq(
  <span class="tooltiprtext">The `pchisq` command allows you to compute p-values from the chi-squared distribution.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
residual deviance,&nbsp;
  <span class="tooltiprtext">The residual deviance is shown at the bottom of the output of your `summary(YourGlmName)` and should be typed in here as a number like 25.3.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
df for residual deviance,&nbsp;
  <span class="tooltiprtext">The df for the residual deviance is also shown at the bottom of the output of your `summary(YourGlmName)`.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
lower.tail=FALSE)
<span class="tooltiprtext">This command ensures you find the probability of the chi-squared distribution being as extreme or more extreme than the observed value of residual deviance.</span>
</span>
</div>
</a>


<div id="multipleGOF2" style="display:none;">
```{r, warning=FALSE}
myglm <- glm(weight>100 ~ Time*Diet, data = ChickWeight, family = binomial)
summary(myglm)

pchisq(256.30, 570, lower.tail = TRUE)
```
</div>


The null hypothesis of the goodness-of-fit test is that the logistic regression is a good fit of the data. So a large p-value (like 0.479) is good because it allows us to trust the results of our logistic regression. When the p-value becomes very small, we must "reject the null" and conclude a poor fit, which implies that we should not trust the results of the logistic regression.

</div>


<br/>

#### Predict Probabilities

To predict the probability that $Y_i=1$ for a given $x$-value, use the code

<a href="javascript:showhide('MultipleLogisticPredict')">
<div class="hoverchunk">
<span class="tooltipr">
predict(
  <span class="tooltiprtext">The predict() function allows us to use the regression model that was obtained from glm() to predict the probability that $Y_i = 1$ for a given $X_i$.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
YourGlmName,&nbsp;
  <span class="tooltiprtext">`YourGlmName` is the name of the object you created when you performed your logistic regression using glm().</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
newdata =&nbsp;
<span class="tooltiprtext">The `newdata = ` command allows you to specify the x-values for which you want to obtain predicted probabilities that $Y_i=1$.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
NewDataFrame,&nbsp;
<span class="tooltiprtext">Typically, NewDataFrame is created in real time using the data.frame( X1 = c(Value 1, Value 2, ...), X2 = c(Value 1, Value 2, ...), ...) command. You should see the GSS example file for an example of how to use this function.</span>
</span><span class="tooltipr">
type = "response")
  <span class="tooltiprtext">The type = "response" options specifies that you want predicted probabilities. There are other options available. See ?predict.glm for details.</span>
</span>
</div>
</a>

<div id="MultipleLogisticPredict" style="display:none;">
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
myglm <- glm(weight>100 ~ Time*Diet, data = ChickWeight, family = binomial)
predict(myglm, newdata = data.frame(Time = 13, Diet = "2"), type = "response")
```

### Explanation

<div style="padding-left:125px;">


Multiple Logistic Regression is used when 

* the response variable is binary $(Y_i=0$ or $1)$, and
* there are multiple explanatory variables $X_1,\ldots,X_p$ that can be either quantitative or qualitative. 


#### The Model

Very little changes in multiple logistic regression from Simple Logistic Regression. The probability that $Y_i = 1$ given the observed data $(x_{i1},\ldots,x_{ip})$ is called $\pi_i$ and is modeled by the expanded equation

$$
  P(Y_i = 1|\, x_{i1},\ldots,x_{ip}) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip}}}{1+e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip} }} = \pi_i
$$

The assumption is that for certain combinations of $X_1,\ldots,X_p$ the probability that $Y_i=1$ is higher than for other combinations. 


#### Interpretation

The model for $\pi_i$ comes from modeling the *log of the odds* that $Y_i=1$ using a linear regression, i.e., 
$$
  \log\underbrace{\left(\frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}\right)}_{\text{Odds for}\ Y_i=1} = \underbrace{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip}}_{\text{linear regression}}
$$ 
Beginning to solve this equation for $\pi_i$ leads to the intermediate, but important result that
$$
    \underbrace{\frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}}_{\text{Odds for}\ Y_i=1} = e^{\overbrace{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \ldots + \beta_p x_{ip}}^{\text{liear regression}}} = e^{\beta_0}e^{\beta_1 x_{i1}}\cdots e^{\beta_p x_{ip}}
$$
As in Simple Linear Regression, the values of $e^{\beta_0}$, $e^{\beta_1}$, $\ldots$, $e^{\beta_p}$ are interpreted as the proportional change in odds for $Y_i=1$ when a given $x$-variable experiences a unit change, *all other variables being held constant*. 


#### Checking the Model Assumptions

Diagnostics are the same in multiple logistic regression as they are in simple logistic regression. 

#### Prediction

The idea behind prediction in multiple logistic regression is the same as in simple logistic regression. The only difference is that more than one explanatory variable is used to make the prediction of the *risk* that $Y_i=1$.
