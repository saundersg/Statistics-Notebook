Think of an `R Markdown File`, or `Rmd` for short, as a command center. You write commands, then Knit the file, and an html output file is created according to your commands.

# Creating Links

To make a link use the code `[Name of Link](addressForLink)`. 

Linking to parts of your textbook:

* `[Numerical Summaries](NumericalSummaries.html)` *becomes* [Numerical Summaries](NumericalSummaries.html)
* `[Boxplots](GraphicalSummaries.html#boxplots)` *becomes* [Boxplots](GraphicalSummaries.html#boxplots)
* `[R Commands](RCommands.html)` *becomes* [R Commands](RCommands.html)

Linking to outside resources:

* `[R Colors](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf)` *becomes* [R Colors](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf)


# Creating Headers

There are six available sizes of headings you can use in an Rmd file (left in image) that show up as shown below (right in image).

# Emphasizing Words

To *italisize* a word use the asterisk (Shift 8) `*italisize*`. To **bold** a word use the double asterisk `**bold**`. The back tic ` ` ` can be used to `highlight` words by placing back tics on each side of a word: ` ` ` highlight ` ` `.

# Bullet Points

## Simple Lists

<div style="float:left;width:300px;">
To achieve the result:

* This is the first item.

* This is the second.

* This is the third.

</div>

<div style="padding-left:350px;">

Use the code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
To achieve the result:
  
* This is the first item.

* This is the second.

* This is the third.
```
</div>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

## Numbered Lists

<div style="float:left;width:300px;">

To achieve the result:

1. This is the first item.

2. This is the second.

3. This is the third.

</div>

<div style="padding-left:350px;">

Use the code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
To achieve the result:
  
1. This is the first item.

2. This is the second.

3. This is the third.
```

</div>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

## Lettered Lists

<div style="float:left;width:300px;">

To achieve the result:

A) This is the first item.

B) This is the second.

C) This is the third.

</div>

<div style="padding-left:350px;">
Use the code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
To achieve the result:
  
A) This is the first item.

B) This is the second.

C) This is the third.
```


</div>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>


## Nested Lists

<div style="float:left;width:300px;">

1. What is $2+2$?

    a. **4**
    
    b. 8
  
2. What is $3\times5$?

    a. 14
    
    b. **15**

</div>

<div style="padding-left:350px;">

```{r, eval=FALSE}
1. What is $2+2$?

    a. **4**
    
    b. 8
  
2. What is $3\times5$?

    a. 14
    
    b. **15**

```

</div>
    
# Math Equations

Use the dollar signs `$x=5$` to write $x=5$ or `$z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$` to write $z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$. For a nicely centered equation use the double dollar signs `$$ $$` on separate lines 

```{}
$$
  z = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$
```

to get
$$
  z = \frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}
$$

Or

```{}
$$
  H_0: \mu_\text{Group 1} = \mu_\text{Group 2}
$$
$$ 
  H_a: \mu_\text{Group 1} \neq \mu_\text{Group 2}
$$
```

to get
$$
  H_0: \mu_{\text{Group 1}} = \mu_{\text{Group 2}}
$$
$$ 
  H_a: \mu_{\text{Group 1}} \neq \mu_{\text{Group 2}}
$$

# Insert a Picture

To add a picture to your document, say some notes you took down on paper from class,

Use the code: `![](./Images/insertPictureNotes.jpg)` to get...

# Tables

There are many ways to [make tables](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html#tables) in R Markdown. Here is a simple way to make a "pipe" table.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
| Name          | Age           | Gender       | 
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Jill          | 8             |  Female      |
| Jack          | 9             |  Male        |
```

| Name          | Age           | Gender       | 
|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| Jill          | 8             |  Female      |
| Jack          | 9             |  Male        |


<br />

# Themes

Notice in the YAML (at the top of the RMD file) there is a line that reads:

"theme: cerulean"

Other possible themes are

* "default", "cerulean", "journal", "flatly", "readable", "spacelab", "united", and "cosmo".

You can also change the `highlighting` by adding the line "highlight: tango" to the YAML as follows.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
---
title: "Markdown Hints"
output: 
  html_document:
    theme: cerulean
    highlight: tango
---
```

Other highlighting options are

* "default", "tango", "pygments", "kate", "monochrome", "espresso", "zenburn", "haddock", and "textmate".
