## Notes

Add your own notes here...

```{r}
# Add R commands you want to remember here...

```

```{r}
# Or create other R chunks to put them in like this...

```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Using ```{r, eval=FALSE} turns off the chunk, but still shows it.
# Useful when you want to remember code, but not run it in this file.
```
